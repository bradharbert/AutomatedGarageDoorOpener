Automated Garage Door Opener using a Particle Photon

Please see the following Blog posting on Harbert.io for additional information on this project:

A couple files here to help you get started....

(1) INO File - this is the firmware code to use with your Photon in the Particle Build UI.  Anything that references Particle. - you can comment out at this stage if you do not want to send the events to the Particle Cloud.

(2) Fritzing - If you are using Fritzing, this file should help you get started with the Breadboard layout and 2D schematic.  Could be a little different based on what components you use - such as relays and reed switches.
